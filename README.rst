pssht
=====

|travis-ci| |coveralls| |hhvm| |readthedocs|

pssht is a PHP library that provides an SSH server that can be embedded
in other applications.

What we're aiming for:

*   Clean code (eg. PSR-2 & PSR-4 compliance, tests, ...)
*   Extensibility
*   Interoperability with as much SSH clients as possible, but mainly
    with the OpenSSH client

What we're not specifically aiming for, but still interested in:

*   Completeness (support for TCP port forwarding, TUN/TAP tunneling,
    the scp/sftp subsystems, ...)
*   Strong security (peer reviews, security audits, ...)


Disclaimer
----------

This should be obvious from the get-go, but **DO NOT USE** pssht in production.
This project merely exists for two reasons:

-   First, I wanted to provide a """somewhat secure""" cross-platform way
    to expose `Erebot internals <https://github.com/Erebot/Erebot>`_
    for introspection purposes and I did not want to install an external
    SSH daemon.
-   Secondly, I wanted to learn more about the SSH protocol itself.

The implementation did not pass any specific security audit. In addition,
no attempt has been made to avoid some common classes of vulnerabilities, eg.
`timing attacks <http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/its-all-about-time.html>`_.
Not to mention that the PHP interpreter itself is known to be frequently
subject to `vulnerabilities of its own
<http://www.cvedetails.com/product/128/PHP-PHP.html?vendor_id=74>`_.

If you are looking for an SSH daemon with thorough testing and code
audits to integrate with your PHP code, we recommend that you look into
the `OpenSSH project <http://www.openssh.com/>`_.

If you still aren't convinced that you shouldn't use this code in production,
see `this reddit page
<http://www.reddit.com/r/lolphp/comments/1yvm6v/php_can_do_anything_what_about_some_ssh_mtgox>`_
which relates part of the story of a project similar to pssht by MtGox's CEO.

In no event shall the authors of pssht be liable for anything that happens
while using this library. Please read the `license`_ for the full disclaimer.


Installation
------------

The requirements for pssht are quite basic:

*   PHP 5.3.3 or later with the following PHP extensions enabled:

    *   ``ctype``
    *   ``DOM``
    *   ``gmp``
    *   ``OpenSSL``
    *   ``Reflection``
    *   ``Sockets``
    *   ``SPL``

    Moreover, certain additional PHP extensions may be used to add support
    for more features:

    *   ``hash``: adds support for a lot more algorithms than the default
        (most message authentication code algorithms, support for ECDSA
        and Ed25519 public keys, support for ECDH and Curve25519
        key exchanges, support for PuTTY's Private Key format, etc.).

    *   ``pecl_http``: adds support for zlib-compression.
        Either version 1.x or 2.x may be used.
        Version 2.x is preferred.

    *   ``mcrypt``: adds support for most encryption algorithms.
        In fact, all the encryption algorithms provided by pssht use this
        extension, except for ``chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com``.
        So, unless all your clients support ``chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com``
        (ie. you only use recent enough versions of OpenSSH to connect),
        you definitely want to install this extension.

    *   ``pcntl``: adds signal handling (to stop pssht gracefully).

    *   ``posix``: improves detection of the current user.

*   Some external packages (they will automatically be installed
    when installing pssht):

    *   ``erebot/plop`` for logging
    *   ``symfony/config`` for configuration handling
    *   ``symfony/dependency-injection`` for dependency injection
    *   ``symfony/filesystem`` (dependency for ``symfony/config``)


First things first, download the `composer.phar
<https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar>`_ executable or use the installer:

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Now, you can either install pssht:

*   As a basic SSH server for evaluation purposes (standalone).

*   As a library/framework in your own project (embedded) to create
    a custom SSH server.

Standalone installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install pssht as a standalone SSH server, clone this repository
and then run Composer on it:

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/fpoirotte/pssht.git
    $ cd pssht
    $ php /path/to/composer.phar update --no-dev

Embedded installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install pssht as an embedded library in your application,
create or update a ``composer.json`` file in your project's
root directory with a requirement on pssht.

For example, for a new empty project, your ``composer.json`` file
would look somewhat like this:

..  sourcecode:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "fpoirotte/pssht": "*"
        }
    }

Run Composer:

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ php /path/to/composer.phar install --no-dev

Finally, copy ``pssht.xml`` to your project's root directory:

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ cp -a vendor/fpoirotte/pssht/pssht.xml ./


Basic usage
-----------

Start the server:

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ php bin/pssht         # for standalone installations
    $                       # ...or...
    $ php vendor/bin/pssht  # for embedded installations

..  note::

    When run like that, pssht will just act as a basic echo server,
    responding with the exact same data that was sent to it.

pssht will display various debugging messages while initializing.
When ready, you will see something like this in the console:

..  sourcecode::

    [Fri, 08 May 2015 20:23:21 +0200] INFO: Listening for new connections on 0.0.0.0:22222

You can now connect to the server with the same user that was used to start
pssht by using your regular SSH client (eg. OpenSSH/PuTTy).
For example, using the OpenSSH client and assuming pssht was run by ``clicky``:

..  sourcecode:: console

    $ ssh -T -p 22222 clicky@localhost
    Hello world!
    clicky@localhost's password: pssht

The default ``pssht.xml`` configuration file automatically loads
the public keys stored in ``~/.ssh/authorized_keys``.
You can thus connect with the matching private key.
It will also accept password-based authentication using "pssht"
as the password.

..  note::

    The ``-T`` option is used to disable pseudo-tty allocation as it is
    not yet supported (see #21). Without it, OpenSSH displays a warning
    in the console (``PTY allocation request failed on channel 0``).


Configuration
-------------

pssht uses the `Dependency Injection component
<http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/>`_
from the Symfony2 framework for its configuration.

Have a look at the default `pssht.xml
<https://github.com/fpoirotte/pssht/blob/master/pssht.xml>`_
configuration file for ways to customize pssht.
The file contains numerous comments and the options
should thus be very straightforward.

The rest of this section describes precisely which algorithms and features
are supported.

**TL;DR** here's a feature chart for comparison with OpenSSH 6.7p1:

-   |[x]| Services (2 in pssht; 2 in OpenSSH)
-   |[ ]| Authentication methods (4 in pssht; ? in OpenSSH)
-   |[ ]| Key exchange methods (6 in pssht; 8 in OpenSSH)
-   |[x]| Encryption algorithms (34 in pssht; 16 in OpenSSH) [#null]_
-   |[x]| MAC algorithms (20 in pssht; 19 in OpenSSH) [#null]_
-   |[ ]| Public key algorithms (6 in pssht; 14 in OpenSSH)
-   |[x]| Compression algorithms (2 in pssht; 2 in OpenSSH) [#null]_

..  [#null] The "none" algorithm has been excluded from those counts.

Services
~~~~~~~~

The following services are supported:

-   ``ssh-userauth``
-   ``ssh-connection``

Authentication methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following authentication methods are supported:

are **not** accepted or generated.

Integration
-----------

pssht is mainly intended to be used as an embedded SSH server for PHP applications.
By default, only the bare structure for an SSH server is provided.
The application using pssht is responsible for adding it's own logic on top
of this structure.

Changelog
---------

v0.1.1
~~~~~~

*   [#28] Temporarily fix Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange by disabling
    public key validation for Elliptic Curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman.
    This code will be revisited later on as it currently represents
    a possible security threat when ECDH is used.

*   Improve this README (installation instructions, changelog).

*   Change the default ``pssht.xml`` so that it accepts connections
    from the same user as the one starting the server
    (prior to this change, it used an hardcoded username).


v0.1.0
~~~~~~

*   Initial release with lots of features already.
